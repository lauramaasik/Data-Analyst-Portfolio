# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
A repository to track my progress and save projects in data analytics

### Analytical projects
Data for this project has been downloaded from Garmin through [Garmin Connect export script](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export), where .properties files were modified through CMD in order to match the necessary attributes to download. Additional data was collected from googledocs link using Python and from HRV4Training app csv file.

The 'running_data_analysis.ipynb' file includes data gathering, cleaning, analysis and visualization. Gathered and cleaned data has been uploaded to Azure database.

Main topics covered:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- jupyter notebook
- Azure database
- numpy
- regex
- loops
- exception handling
- CMD
- data types
- datetimes
- SQL
